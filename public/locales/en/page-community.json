  "page-community-occ-description": "OCC is the core principle of Shardeum. OCC is short for Open, Collaborative and Community driven approach in the effort to install a truly <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/best-decentralized-storage-networks/' target='_blank' >decentralized network</a> to connect billions of unserved, underserved and ordinary people across the world. It is no different from the initial days of the internet where the only CEO was the community who believed when others around dismissed the idea. But the community would not have found long lasting success if not for the open source architecture of the internet. If it was privatized or commoditized, it could still be successful but not at a scale we see today uplifting billions out of poverty. With the introduction of cryptography in open source blockchain, we have a great opportunity to make that success reach more people and communities than ever without compromising on privacy or security.",
